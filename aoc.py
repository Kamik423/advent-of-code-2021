"""Library to get advent of code input for 2021.

It uses a cookie file (COOKIE.txt) to authenticate you on the aoc server. It
then downloads and caches the input as not to spam the server.

The cookie is a long hexadecimal number that you can manually extract from a
manual request in your browser. Extract it and put it into the file COOKIE.txt
next to your main Python scripts. Remember to append COOKIE.txt to your
.gitignore.

Files will be downloaded to a directory named `input` in the same directory as
your main Python script. It will be created if it does not exist. For every day
the script downloads the input and returns it from there. You don't need to
manually call code to download the file, it will just happen automatically the
first time you request anything for that day. All you have to do is call one
of the following lines:

    aoc.get(1) # bytes data for day one
    aoc.get_str(1) # string data for day one
    aoc.get_lines(1) # input lines for day one
    aoc.get_integers(1) # integers for day one (one per line)

    aoc.get_integers() # when called from `01-minimal.py` gets ints for day 1.

You can also leave out the number and it will get guessed from the file name of
the main Python file by just taking all the numbers in the file name. So for
example `day_03.py` or `03-alternate.py` would query day 3; however files like
`aoc-2021-day-03-part-2.py` would attempt to query day 2021032 which is not
what you want. You can rewrite that method, rename your files, or specify the
day manually.

This module also provides timer functionality.
